Simplifying Impactivism for Easy Adoption

1. One Score, One Currency
Everyone has a single Impact Score and uses the same Impact Credits:
- Impact Score
• Negative: harm
• Zero: rest or neutrality
• Positive: verified benefit
- Impact Credits
Earn by raising your Score, spend on extras (community projects, small grants).

2. Core Rights & Rewards
- Universal Access
Score ≥ 0 guarantees food, housing, healthcare, education.
- Greater Influence
Higher Scores unlock faster credit earning and more decision-making power.

3. How It Works: Three-Tier Governance
- Proposal Vetting (AI + Citizens)
• Anyone—or the AI assistant—submits an idea.
• AI checks legality, cost, overlaps, and predicts impact.
• Top 3–5 proposals surface in clear, simple summaries.
- Local Level: Neighborhood Jury
• Who: Random draw from citizens above an Impact-Score threshold.
• AI Role: Presents vetted summaries and highlights risks.
• Decision: Jury votes by consent on which project to fund.
- Regional Level: Liquid Democracy
• Who: All citizens (Score ≥ 0).
• AI Role: Matches you with trusted delegates, outlines pros/cons, forecasts outcomes.
• Decision: You vote “yes/no” or delegate your vote; AI tallies results.
- National Level: Expert Council
• Who: Top 1–3% by Impact Score in key fields.
• AI Role: Gathers data, drafts policies, runs “what-if” simulations.
• Decision: Council refines AI drafts, votes to adopt, and AI tracks implementation.

4. Simple Mechanics
- Do Good → Score Up → Credits Up
Plant trees, teach, restore habitat → Score +10 → Earn 10 Credits.
- Rest → Score Stays → Safe
Take downtime with no penalty; rights remain intact.
- Do Harm → Score Down → Repair
Harm leads to negative points; follow a short restitution plan to recover.

5. Getting Started
- Form a Local Group
Neighborhood, workplace, or online circle.
- Agree on Basic Values
Define one Score threshold for eligibility and simple credit values for common deeds.
- Set Up AI Vetting
Configure a basic AI assistant to shortlist proposals.
- Launch Governance
• Draw your first jury.
• Open your first regional ballot.
• Invite top contributors to the inaugural expert council.
That’s it—one Score, one currency, and three clear tiers of decision-making powered by AI and human judgment. Easy to explain, easy to adopt.
