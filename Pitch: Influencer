### Pitch: "Be the Architect of the Shift"

Impactivism is the next civilizational story—and you can help shape its mythos. Build gatherings, media, and movements that raise others' Impact Scores.

Everything you launch—retreats, podcasts, challenges—becomes a tracked contribution, earning prestige and cultural capital. You don’t just narrate the shift. You ignite it.

### Strategic Notes
✅ Use “movement architect”, “tracked uplift”, “story-as-contribution”  
❗ Avoid jargon; center authenticity, purpose, and creative agency
