### Profile
Entrepreneur, startup veteran, innovator. Often post-exit, seeking high-impact legacy.

### Core Motivations
- Disruption and innovation
- Scalability
- Legacy beyond financial gain

### Pitch: "Scale Without Burnout — The Post-Exit Economy"

You've built platforms, scaled solutions, and exited with success. Impactivism invites you to architect what comes *after* capitalism. Your innovations can power clinics, restore ecosystems, and elevate communities—with automatic prestige and measurable legacy.

Your Impact Score becomes your new KPI. Contribution replaces monetization as the true measure of genius. Less pitch deck, more blueprint for a thriving civilization.

### Strategic Notes
✅ Use terms like “open-source”, “scalable good”, “post-exit influence”  
❗ Avoid framing as charity or retirement; emphasize power + creativity
