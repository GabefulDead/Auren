The Life of a Construction Worker in Auren
It’s 6:30 a.m. when Mateo’s feet hit the earth.

He stretches, bones clicking into readiness—not because he’s under pressure to clock in, but because he wants today’s structure to stand proud in the skyline. The old kind of pressure, the desperate kind—where a missed shift could mean eviction or skipped meals—is gone. In Auren, no one builds under coercion. Mateo builds because he can, and because what he builds matters.

Today’s site is a community learning hub. It’s round and airy by design, partially embedded into the hillside. The children helped choose the materials last month. The solar glazing was selected by a team of engineers and local elders, balancing aesthetics with passive energy needs. Mateo doesn’t “work for” anyone. He’s part of a multi-skill cooperative that rotates roles weekly—some days he supervises, other days he lays brick, sometimes he just checks measurements and brings sandwiches.

He doesn’t earn “wages” in the old sense. Instead, his Impact Score rises as the project nears completion—reflected not in dollars, but in how many lives this building will touch: students, mentors, artists, parents. The more resilient, efficient, and dignified the structure, the more weight his contribution carries. His score affects his access to high-impact tools, priority project proposals, and certain forums where long-term development decisions are made. But no score, high or low, can take away his housing, food, or care. Those are guaranteed. Just like rest days. Today is not one, but tomorrow might be.

At lunch, he sits under a scaffold with a woman who specializes in rewilding rooftops. They swap stories—her last project involved turning a parking deck into an herb sanctuary. She’ll gain impact for every new species her garden supports. Mateo marvels at how differently they build, yet how their impact scores intersect—hers healing skyward, his rising from the soil.

Mateo remembers his father, who worked construction too. Back then, it was about surviving bids, taking unsafe jobs, hoping you wouldn’t get stiffed or replaced by temp labor. Safety was a luxury. Retirement, a joke. The thought tightens his jaw.

But then he looks at the framing rising behind him, the curvature of the dome catching soft morning light. He looks at his hands, calloused, deliberate, weathered not by struggle but by creation. And the weight in his chest softens.

After the day’s final inspection, Mateo logs the team’s progress. The building is 82% complete. His impact for the week: +4.1. Not bad. Tomorrow, he’s scheduled to guide apprentices through reinforced timber. One of them, a quiet kid named Nasir, designed a tool that reduces joint stress by 30%. If it works, Nasir’s score might jump sharply. Mateo hopes it does.

He smiles, stepping back. The hub gleams under the setting sun, not a monument to capital, but a shelter of potential.

In Auren, construction doesn’t exploit—it uplifts. And so does Mateo.
