Subject: Your Power Could Be Part of the Solution

Dear [Name or Organization],

The world is changing. Old systems are cracking under the weight of inequality, ecological collapse, and social unrest. But within every problem lies potential—and those with the greatest influence today have the rare opportunity to shape what comes next.

You are one of those people.

The enclosed Constitution of Auren outlines a framework for a new civilization—one built not on unchecked accumulation, but on measurable, restorative impact. Rather than condemn those whose actions have caused harm, we invite them to convert that momentum into something redeeming.

Auren’s Impactism allows for rebalancing: Through reparative acts and alignment with community-oriented goals, negative scores can be neutralized, and privilege can be retained—honorably.

We invite you to participate, endorse, or pilot this system with us. Let your legacy be one of redemption, not extraction.

Respectfully,
The Auren Transitional Committee
