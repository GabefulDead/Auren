The Life of a Doctor in Auren
Dr. Samira Bel had her first cup of tea before the sun rose, just like always. She liked the silence. In that space, she could think—not about billing codes or malpractice liability or how many patients she needed to see to keep the clinic solvent—but about people. Real people.

In Auren, medicine is no longer a service you can afford—or not. It is a sacred trust, upheld not for profit, but for impact.

Samira doesn’t track hours anymore. She tracks outcomes. When she helps reverse someone’s chronic condition through diet and stress management, her Impact Score rises. When she co-designs a mental health protocol with her neurodivergent patients, it rises again. She doesn’t get bonuses. She gets voice—a greater ability to influence policy, mentor new medics, and request rare resources.

Her clinic—no longer a private practice—is a community health cooperative. It includes not just physicians but nutritionists, herbalists, elders, and even former patients who’ve trained to support others. She doesn’t “run” it. She co-stewards it.

On her morning rounds, she visits Farid—a man whose lungs were scarred in the last days of the old system, working in a plastics plant. In the past, Samira might have rushed him through a 7-minute consult and sent him away with antibiotics. Now, she sits. She listens. His breathing is improving thanks to the herbal steam treatments and clean air tech. His granddaughter, who helps tend to the clinic garden, also logs this improvement—it contributes to her Impact Score too.

Samira’s tools are different now. She still has advanced diagnostics, digital records, and AI-powered pattern recognition—but she also uses slow medicine: food, touch, story. She teaches preventative health in public squares. She walks neighborhoods after community meetings, noting areas that need attention—elderly folks who aren’t showing up, kids with persistent coughs, food stands that might need hygiene upgrades.

One afternoon a week, she meets with the Council of Caregivers—a group of high-impact medical workers from across Auren. Together, they debate policies. Should certain treatments be universally available? Should pain relief be prioritized in restoration centers? How do we integrate non-Western modalities with data-backed standards? Samira’s voice matters—not because she’s wealthy or credentialed, but because her long-term Impact Score confirms what her patients already know: she makes lives better.

And yet, if tomorrow she needed a break—if she were to step back, rest, tend her garden—her rights would remain untouched. In Auren, rest is sacred, too. There is no burnout badge. No pressure to perform. No need to fear that stepping down means falling through the cracks.

She remembers, vaguely, the old system. She studied in its twilight. Saw hospitals run like corporations. Saw people denied care because of paperwork or zip codes. That world still lives in her memory, like a fever that finally broke.

Now, healing is not rationed. It is cultivated.

And Samira? She is not owned by her work. She is honored by it.
