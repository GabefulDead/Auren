Auren is a proposed civilization model designed to replace systems of exploitation and economic injustice. It runs on two foundational principles:

Impactism: Economic reward is based on positive contribution (wellbeing, sustainability, education, etc.). You gain influence by making life better for others.

Symvaratic Governance: Power is decentralized, democratic, and transparent. Influence is earned through service and preserved through accountability.

Auren retools human drives like greed and ambition into fuel for collective good. It promises a world where people are safe by default, respected for their contributions, and protected from harm by design.

Auren envisions a world free from exploitative hierarchies, where economic activity and political influence are aligned with measurable benefit to people and planet. 
Rooted in the economic principle of Impactism and governed by a decentralized system called Symvaratic Governance, Auren rewards contributions to communal well-being, not wealth accumulation. 
Basic rights are guaranteed. Greed is rechanneled toward service. And power is held by those with the greatest positive impact.
