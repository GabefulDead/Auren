### Profile
Landowner, builder, urban strategist. Invests in physical infrastructure and long-term development.

### Core Motivations
- Asset resilience
- Urban legacy
- Navigating regulations and public sentiment

### Pitch: "Invest in Cities That Want You There"

Under Impactivism, developments that increase well-being automatically earn credits, prestige, and policy support. Think green rooftops, housing trusts, public gardens—with built-in ROI.

No more angry zoning boards or community protests. You build what benefits people *and* profit—measured, visible, and protected. Influence rises with contribution.

### Strategic Notes
✅ Use “regenerative zoning”, “impact-verified permits”, “community-backed valuation”  
❗ Avoid language that implies ceding control or land ownership
