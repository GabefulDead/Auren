The Life of a Student in Auren
Learning without fear. Growing with purpose.

Zora is twelve, and she’s already failed two things this year:

Her first community cooking event (burned everything).

And a composting science project (mold everywhere).

She’s also earned a +1.7 Impact Score for helping her neighbor walk again after surgery—just by being patient, listening, and learning to cook rice properly the second time.

In Auren, grades don’t exist. Impact does.

Zora is not measured by how many facts she memorizes, but by how deeply she engages with the world.

Education Without Competition
Her “school” is a Living Knowledge Garden—a hybrid of community center, lab, maker space, and forest. It doesn’t look like much: low buildings with grass rooftops, a pond with solar lily pads, a blacksmith forge beside a recording studio.

Here, Zora doesn’t sit through hours of lectures. She chooses her learning tracks based on what pulls at her curiosity. Everyone studies core literacies—math, language, emotional awareness—but beyond that, students pursue real-world projects guided by impact mentors.

Right now, Zora is deep into:

A storytelling project about local flood myths and modern hydrology.

A collaborative problem-solving workshop with three elders and a retired engineer.

Learning consent and conflict navigation through live role-play and neighborhood theater.

Failure is Fertile Ground
When Zora's first compost experiment failed, she wasn’t scolded or docked points. Instead, her mentor said:

“That’s part of your impact. Negative impact isn’t evil—it’s data. What will you do with it?”

Now she’s co-leading a soil workshop with two friends, testing fungi networks for remediation. The old world would have called that extra credit. In Auren, it’s called growth.

Intergenerational Learning
Zora learns with people of all ages. Her best science partner is a 56-year-old carpenter named Muna. Her poetry coach is a teenager rebuilding from anxiety. Her mental health lessons come from a trauma counselor and a midwife. Everyone teaches. Everyone learns.

No one is “just a student.”
Everyone is a contributor in progress.

Real Power in Young Hands
Zora and her classmates are already involved in real governance. Every student over ten can sit in Youth Assemblies, which propose policy changes to local councils. Last year, their campaign to replace synthetic turf with native grasses passed unanimously.

Their Impact Scores rose—not because they “won,” but because their campaign:

Reduced environmental stress

Increased community cohesion

Made the local park safe for elders with allergies

Zora wasn’t just learning civics. She was civics.

No Shame. No Scarcity. Just Becoming.
Zora’s best friend, Milo, is autistic. He doesn't speak much. He builds things—intricate sculptures, air-purifying fans made from junkyard parts. In the old world, Milo would’ve been tracked into a “special” program, maybe excluded entirely.

In Auren, Milo is a recognized innovator. His impact is logged, seen, and celebrated.

Zora looks up to him.

The Future, as They Define It
When asked what she wants to be, Zora shrugs.

“I want to help design lakes for dry cities. Or maybe make memory museums for people who lose theirs. Or maybe I’ll just be kind to strangers and grow tomatoes.”

And that would be enough.

Because in Auren, you don’t have to be a “success.” You just have to show up, learn, and contribute however you can. Impact isn’t about prestige. It’s about presence.

Closing Scene
Zora walks home through a grove of fruit trees planted by last year’s graduating class. She picks one. It tastes like lemon and pine and summer.

Next week, she’ll teach younger students about soil acidity. She’s still figuring it out.

But she’ll show them her moldy old compost bucket.

And they’ll laugh. And they’ll learn.

Because that’s what students do in Auren.
