### Profile
Global investor, data-driven strategist, risk arbitrageur. Seeks competitive edge in markets.

### Core Motivations
- Uncorrelated returns
- Macroeconomic foresight
- Resilience and liquidity

### Pitch: "Arbitrage the Future — Impact as Alpha"

Forget legacy indexes. The real undervalued asset is positive impact. Back co-ops, clean tech, rewilding platforms before governments catch up.

Impactivist markets expose exploitative sectors and reward regenerative finance. It's not idealism—it's a new algorithm. Predictive alpha with prestige built in.

### Strategic Notes
✅ Use “impact arbitrage”, “pre-legal alpha”, “post-fiat resilience”  
❗ Avoid moralizing; emphasize performance and market asymmetry
