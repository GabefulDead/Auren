AI-Assisted Three-Tier Governance

A clear, simple system where AI supports humans at every level. Citizens and AI jointly propose ideas. AI vets them, then human bodies decide:
- Local juries handle neighborhood projects.
- Regional assemblies vote directly or delegate.
- National experts refine and finalize big-picture policy.

How It Works
------------
1. Proposal Submission & Vetting
   Anyone—or the community AI—submits an idea. AI checks for duplicates, legal or budget issues, and predicts impact. The top 3–5 proposals emerge in plain language.

2. Local Level (Neighborhood Jury)
   • Selection: Random draw from high-Impact citizens.
   • AI Role: Summarizes proposals, flags risks.
   • Decision: Jury discusses AI summaries, then votes by consent.

3. Regional Level (Liquid Democracy)
   • Participants: All citizens with Score ≥ 0.
   • AI Role: Matches you with delegates, clarifies pros/cons, forecasts regional effects.
   • Decision: You vote “yes/no” or delegate your vote; AI records results.

4. National Level (Expert Council)
   • Selection: Top 1–3% by Impact Score in key fields.
   • AI Role: Gathers data, drafts policies, runs “what-if” simulations.
   • Decision: Council refines AI drafts, votes to adopt, and AI publishes implementation tracking.

FAQ
---
Q: Why involve AI at every tier?
A: AI handles research, vetting, and forecasting so people spend time on judgment and consensus—never on data overload.

Q: How are jury members chosen?
A: By lottery from citizens above an Impact Score threshold. Each serves one term per cycle.

Q: Can I change my delegate?
A: Yes—from the regional level, you can reassign your vote at any time.

Q: What if AI is biased or wrong?
A: All AI models are open-source and audited by rotating citizen teams. Citizens can flag errors and demand recalibration.

Q: How often do decisions happen?
A: Local juries meet quarterly. Regional ballots open monthly. National council convenes as needed for major policies.

Pros and Cons
-------------
Pros
- Clarity: One process, three clear tiers.
- Efficiency: AI vetting and forecasting speeds decisions.
- Inclusivity: Anyone can propose; minimal voters serve.
- Accountability: Open AI code, public minutes, and appeals.

Cons
- AI Dependence: System performance hinges on AI quality and fairness.
- Digital Divide: Requires broad access to tech and literacy.
- Over-Centralization Risk: National expert council may accumulate too much influence.
- Transparency Overhead: Auditing AI and maintaining open data demands constant vigilance.
