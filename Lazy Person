The Life of a Lazy Person in Auren
(or: How Doing Absolutely Nothing Still Counts for Something)

Jasper is not what you’d call “motivated.”

He’s never climbed a mountain. He has never drafted a proposal. He once planted a tree but only because someone handed him a shovel and a coffee afterward. Even in Auren—a society that reveres contribution—Jasper’s greatest daily output is his gentle sigh as he settles into a sun-warmed bench.

And that’s fine.

Because in Auren, doing no harm still counts for something.

Jasper’s Impact Score? Steady. Not heroic, but neutral—and proudly so. He doesn’t pollute. Doesn’t exploit. Doesn’t scam the elderly or dump toxic sludge into rivers. He eats food grown within walking distance. Shares his leftover soup. Says thank you to bus drivers. That’s enough.

You see, in Auren, rest isn’t suspect. It’s sacred.

A Day in the Life (Such As It Is)
10:03 a.m. – Jasper wakes up. Not to an alarm. He hates alarms. He lets the birds argue outside his window until their squawking merges with his dreams and coaxes him awake.

10:15 a.m. – He opens his phone. Not for news. For poetry. Today’s poem is about moss. He likes moss. It’s the lazy man’s flower—quiet, patient, deeply committed to being green without making a fuss.

11:00 a.m. – A neighbor texts. “Wanna help me lift some crates?” Jasper responds, “I support you emotionally.” The neighbor gives him a thumbs-up emoji. That’s enough.

12:30 p.m. – Lunch appears. It’s part of the Universal Provision Loop. Jasper didn’t cook it. But the community cafe knows him. “He doesn’t eat mushrooms,” the volunteer says. “Makes him sleepy. Well… sleepier.”

How Jasper Contributes (Without Trying Too Hard)
He smiles at children. Kids need that.

He remembers everyone’s dog’s name even if he forgets their human’s.

He once defused an argument in a public square by saying, “Hey… life’s short, and we’re all just future compost.” People laughed. Conflict softened.

He writes haikus. Posts them on park bulletin boards. One went viral. Accidentally.

Why Auren Needs People Like Jasper
In the old world, people like him were shamed. Called “lazy,” “unproductive,” “a drain.” But what was all that “productivity” really doing? Making billionaires richer? Filling oceans with microplastics?

Auren doesn’t demand hustle. It doesn’t confuse busyness with virtue. Jasper lives simply. He harms no one. He shares what he has. He’s present. That’s impact enough.

And sometimes, very rarely, Jasper surprises everyone.

Like the time he gave a speech at the Solstice Festival.

He shuffled up to the mic, scratched his head, and said,
“I don’t do much. But I think… not doing bad things is kind of a good thing. So thanks for letting me be here and, uh… sit around a lot.”

The crowd cheered. He got +0.3 Impact Score just for making people feel seen.

Closing Thought
Jasper might not build cities or write manifestos. But in a world obsessed with movement, he teaches stillness. In a society built on impact, he is a living reminder that peace has a place, too.

And tomorrow?

He’ll probably nap again.

And that’s just fine.
