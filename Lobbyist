The Life of a Lobbyist in Auren
Once, Dario Renshaw was a fixer.

He moved bills through broken systems. Smoothed hands with dinners. Turned public tragedies into talking points. In the old world, he was good at it—too good. But no one remembers his name from that era. They only remember what his clients got away with.

That was before Auren.

Today, Dario is still a lobbyist—if you can call it that. The job has changed so much it barely resembles its ancestor. Gone are the smoky backrooms, the PAC donations, the half-truth campaigns. Influence, under Impactivism, is not for sale. It is earned. And it is visible.

Dario is now known as a Public Impact Advocate—a person who collects stories, evidence, and communal insights, and presents them to policy-shaping forums for consideration. His job is not to manipulate legislation in favor of wealthy clients but to amplify the needs of underrepresented communities through verified, democratic channels.

His Impact Score, once buried in hidden dealings, is now fully public. Every proposal he submits, every alliance he builds, every platform he helps rise or dismantle is scored—not based on how persuasive it is, but on what outcomes it produces for society at large.

This week, Dario is preparing a presentation on behalf of an urban gardening coalition. Their proposal: turn vacant commercial rooftops into modular food forests, with community access, education pods, and pollinator habitats. In the old system, this would have been a grant-writing hustle—pleading for scraps. Now, it’s a formal case in a regional Resource Allocation Assembly. If the project scores high enough on anticipated impact—nutrition, biodiversity, local resilience—it will be greenlit and supported by distributed funds and volunteer credits.

Dario doesn’t spin facts anymore. He presents interactive impact models. He doesn’t schmooze. He curates coalitions. When he speaks, it is because he has done the listening first.

He still wears a suit—he likes the structure. But there’s no ego behind the lapels. His reputation is not built on charm but on outcomes. He lost some friends in the early years—those who couldn’t adapt to a world where slickness lost to sincerity. But he gained something more lasting: trust.

At a community debrief later that week, a local activist confronts him. “You used to help oil companies greenwash themselves,” she says, eyes steady. Dario nods. He doesn’t deny it. “And now I help frontline communities decarbonize policy, access tools, protect sovereignty,” he replies. “Because impact is all that counts now. And every day, I’m still repaying the past.”

In Auren, redemption isn’t just possible—it’s built into the architecture. Influence doesn’t disappear; it is re-anchored. The lobbyist doesn’t vanish; he transforms.

And so, Dario moves through the marble halls once more. But now, his only client is the common good.
