THE CONSTITUTION OF AUREN

Preamble We, the Founders of Auren, establish this Constitution to forge a world in which well-being, dignity, and justice are the cornerstones of society. By realigning human incentive with collective good, we reject systems that reward extraction and exploitation. We embrace a new order based on Impact and Consensus.

2.2 Every person, regardless of Impact Score, retains full access to all guaranteed basic rights.
